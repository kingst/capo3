Here are the places where we have the kernel call into the replay
driver.  In all cases the current process is a process that is part of
the replay sphere unless otherwise noted explicitly.

replay_syscall_enter: called at the entrance to all system calls.

replay_syscall_exit: called after executing the system call.

replay_thread_create: called before executing a newly created thread.
For this call the rtcb is not going to be set yet and it might get
called on a thread that is different that current.

replay_thread_exit: called when the OS is going to kill a thread.

replay_switch_to: called as part of the context switching function in
the kernel.  prev_p is the current process and next_p is the process
that the kernel is about to switch in.

replay_general_protection: called on general protection faults, the
replay module uses this to emulate rdtsc and cpuid instructions.

replay_copy_to_user: called when the kernel is about copy data into a
thread that is part of a replay sphere.

replay_send_signal: called when the kernel is about to deliver a
signal to a process.
