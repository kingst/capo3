This project is a system called Capo3, a system for recording and
replaying Linux processes.  To build the system you compile the kernel
like normal, and select the "CONFIG_RECORD_REPLAY" configuration
option.  The source code for the kernel module is located at:

arch/x86/replay/replay.c

And scattered throughout the rest of the kernel.  To find the other
places where replay specific code resides try grepping for
CONFIG_RECORD_REPLAY and you will see the additions to the kernel
proper.

Development of this software was paid for in part by NSF grant CNS
08-34738, grant N0014-09-1-0743 from the Office of Naval Research,
AFOSR MURI grant FA9550-09-01-0539, and a gift from Intel as part of
the I2PC center at the University of Illinois.
