Here are the places where we have the kernel call into the replay
driver.  In all cases the current process is a process that is part of
the replay sphere unless otherwise noted explicitly.

rr_syscall_enter: called at the entrance to all system calls.

rr_syscall_exit: called after executing the system call.

rr_thread_create: called before executing a newly created thread.  For
this call the rtcb is not going to be set yet and it might get called
on a thread that is different than current.

rr_thread_exit: called when the OS is going to kill a thread.

rr_switch_to: called as part of the context switching function in the
kernel.  prev_p is the current process and next_p is the process that
the kernel is about to switch in.

rr_general_protection: called on general protection faults, the replay
module uses this to emulate rdtsc and cpuid instructions.

rr_copy_to_user: called when the kernel is about copy data into a
thread that is part of a replay sphere.

rr_send_signal: called when the kernel is about to deliver a signal to
a process.
